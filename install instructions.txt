1.- Open terminal

2.- Go to folder Teysu_setup using the following command:

cd Teysu

3.- Next, write in terminal:

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

4.- Follow the instructions that will appear after a few seconds, and all should go ok. Please, at the end,
    uncheck the "Launch XAMPP after installation", we won't use it.

5.- After XAMPP installation is complete, the next step is to setup a Teysu working environment. This will be
    done automatically, you don't need to worry about this. Wait a few minutes for the setup to finish.
    Basically, this is what is done here:

    - Uploading of source files of Teysu
    - Setup of environment
    - Setup of Teysu Database

6.- At the end, you will have a Teysu working environment which you can access from your pc. To do that, open
    your web browser and go to "localhost". You will see the Teysu login page. To log in and start your Teysu
    experience, enter the following credentials:

    Username: Teysu
    Password: 2019Teysu9102

That's all for now.
